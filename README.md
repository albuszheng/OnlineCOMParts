Project for the database management class (2016 Spring INFSCI2710) 

The goal for the project is to design a relatively complex yet reasonably useful in the real life database.
It's a web application, built on PHP using Laravel and MySql.

Currently it's still under development (you know, actual deadline for this is still some blocks away).
